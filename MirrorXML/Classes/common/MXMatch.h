/**
 A block object that is called when the pattern is matched in the incoming xml document. This is called before any subsequent elements or child elements are matched.
 
 The block takes a single MXElement * parameter and must return an array of MXMatch objects, or nil.
 
 The block may return either 'nil' or an array of MXMatch objects that are used to match elements until the parser exits the current element. Note: The paths associated with these returned MXMatch objects are 'relative' to this level of the document.

/**
 A block that is called when libxml encounters an error during parsing. This block will only be called if an error is encountered inside an xml element (or child element) matched by this MXMatch object's pattern.
 
 The block takes an NSError * parameter, and an MXElement * parameter (the element being parsed where the error occurred).
 
 To get a callback that will occur if an error is encountered anywhere in the document, create an MXMatch object with the pattern '(/)(/)*' without the parentheses, and assign a block object to this property.
 
 Note that errors encountered during html parsing (with MXHTMLParser) are often not fatal (for libxml).

/**
 Convenience constructor. Constructs a new MXMatch object with a new MXPattern object using the XPath-style path and namespaces parameters.
 
 Element/attribute names are case-sensitive for xml contexts. They are case-insensitive for html contexts.
 
 Some examples:
 
 /root/child             --> Match 'child' elements that are children of 'root'
 
 /root/child/child       --> Match 'child' elements that are children of 'child' that are children of 'root'
 
 /root/child/@attrName   --> Match 'child' elements (that are children of 'root') that have an attribute named 'attrName'.
 
 The asterisk character is a wildcard, it matches any element. Use it in place of an element name.
 
 //                      --> Path flattener. Use it in place of a '/' character. Matches the path that follows it at any level.
 
 /root/ns:child          --> The child element is specified with a namespace prefix. The 'ns' prefix is mapped to a full namespace URI in the namespaces dictionary parameter.
 
 @param path The path to match. This is a simplified XPath-style path, passed here as an NSString, and parsed by libxml. Complex predicates are not accepted.
 
 @param namespaces A dictionary mapping prefix keys to URI namespace values. The prefix is used to internally identify prefixes in the `path` parameter and doesn't necessarily refer to the arbitrary prefix would be used in the actual xml document being scanned.
 
 @param error Returns an NSError object if the path cannot be parsed for some reason.
